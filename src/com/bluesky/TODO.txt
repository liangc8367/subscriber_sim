1. impl exec context
- timer task, to execute in dedicated thread context (done, Mar 14))
- udp packet, to execute in dedicated thread context (done, Mar 14)
- udp fast path (postpone)

2. integrate subscriber/exec context (started on Mar 14)

2. mic simulator? (just replay recorded file?)
3. spkr simulator? (just to record incoming data?)
- generate noise and validate it (done, Mar 21)

4. test harness (started on Mar 21)
-
- monkey to press/release ptt randomly
- zoo: a group of monkey
- farmer:
   # create subscribers
   # gather/validate stats and ongoing call info from each subscriber
- monkey (single press, single sub)
   # issue: trunk side: unexpected sender (fixed, shall validate-packet using 'equals', rather than ==)
   # issue: rx listener su rxed (invalid packet)? strange (fixed, protocol helper cosmetic bug)
   # issue: tx su: send packet or not? (fixed, forgot to register mic/spkr)
   # issue: quick release ptt in TxInit (fixed, ut tested)
   # issue: fixed: ptt shall set callInfo as default one
   # issue: tx-init: validate call granted after timer expired 3 times (fixed.)
       # issue: negative delay? (send dummy mic data as the 1st audio packet)
   # issue: call-hang: use count down count as payload so all listeners can know when the expected due time
   # issue: (not an issue) why all Subs returned to offline? (time out after 5 mins)
